core will contain the installation code
   which can create a new website
core\ folder descriptions
   \assests-> all node_modules will be placed here and we are using browerify for every things
   \bin -> tasks like dump db,repair db, backupdb, exports, imports etc. Also repair a website
   \config -> core modules configuration files
   \includes -> files which are responsible for installation process
   \lib -> All other custom code in form of modules
   \modules -> alias modules which are required to do servral things,
   \theme ->  themes of installation process.





Alias Dashboard show all available site
side by side folder having folder as alias
[doubt]{only core has functionality to update modules of other sites / other ste also have all tings}


configurations will be devided into two parts development/production
  may be futher on test

[Need to follow up with TDD approach]
